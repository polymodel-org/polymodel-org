# polymodel.org

Static landing site for [PolyModel](https://github.com/polymodel-org/polymodel),
the open specification for canonical data models. Single page, no build step:
plain `index.html` + `style.css` + a tiny `script.js` (scroll-reveal only).
Served as Cloudflare Workers static assets (the new Workers static-assets
setup, not legacy Pages).

## Layout

```
polymodel-dev/
├── public/            # everything served to the browser
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── script.js
│   └── favicon.svg
├── wrangler.jsonc     # Workers config (assets.directory = "public")
└── README.md
```

## Local preview

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

Serves `public/` locally with the same asset handling Cloudflare uses in
production. Open the printed `http://localhost:8787` URL.

## Deploy

### Primary: Cloudflare Workers Builds (git-connected, auto-deploy on push)

Deployment is automatic once the repository is connected in the Cloudflare
dashboard under **Workers & Pages → (this Worker) → Settings → Builds**
(Workers Builds), with:

- **Root directory:** `/` (repo root)
- **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy`

On every push to `main`, Cloudflare's builder runs `npx wrangler deploy`,
reads `wrangler.jsonc`, and publishes the contents of `public/`. No manual
step is needed.

### Fallback: manual deploy

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Run it from the repo root.

## Custom domain

`polymodel.org` is attached to the Worker through the Cloudflare dashboard:
**Workers & Pages → (this Worker) → Settings → Domains & Routes → Custom
Domains**. Cloudflare provisions the TLS certificate automatically once the
domain's DNS is on Cloudflare.

## Content

Page copy is distilled from the PolyModel design docs:

- `README.md` — spec overview, concepts, projections, roadmap
- `polymodel-catalog-idea.md` — the Git-native Catalog ecosystem
- `polymodel-composition-strategy.md` — composition over inheritance
